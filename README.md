# Neopets Dailies Grabber
Collects a variety of free dailies from Neopets. 

## Installation
First you'll need a userscript manager in order to install --- [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) if you're using Chrome, or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox.

Once that's done, just click [here](https://github.com/vokrum/neopets-dailiesGrabber/raw/master/neopets-dailies-grabber.user.js) to install.

## Usage

The script should now run from the start once you visit http://www.neopets.com.

It should grab the following dailies---
* Giant Omelette
* Giant Jelly
* Interest from the Neopian Bank
* Anchor Management
* The Fruit Machine
* Coltzan's Shrine
* Underwater Fishing
* The Blue Grundo Plushie
* Healing Springs
* The Shop of Offers
* Monthly Freebies (reward is only available once a month)
* Apple Bobbing
* The Deserted Tomb

After these have been completed, you should be brought to your inventory.

Note that a few of the dailies included (Apple Bobbing and the Deserted Tomb) can result in negative outcomes that can do damage to your pets, cause them to become sick, or make you lose Neopoints or items. Proceed with caution!

## To-Do List

There are a few more dailies the script should also visit---
* Tombola
* The Snowager
* The Advent Calendar
* Potentially Trudy's Surprise and/or the Qasalan Expellibox?

Also not entirely sure that the Fruit Machine is working. Make sure to double check that, among other things

Given that some of the dailies can also be detrimental at times, it'd be nice to let people choose which ones they want. That might take some more work, though.
