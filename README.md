# Chokato
Chrome extension which collects a variety of free dailies from Neopets. 

## Installation

The app can be found on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chokato/jmilhjapknjfojghfjplhmoikmmcnbfp?hl=en-US). It's still not done, so you can enable/disable it on the Chrome extensions page (chrome://extensions).

## Usage

The extension should now run from the start once you visit http://www.neopets.com.

It should grab the following dailies---
* Giant Omelette
* Giant Jelly
* Coltzan's Shrine
* Underwater Fishing
* The Blue Grundo Plushie
* Healing Springs
* The Shop of Offers
* Monthly Freebies (reward is only available once a month)
* Apple Bobbing
* The Deserted Tomb

After these have been completed, you should be brought to your inventory.

Note that a few of the dailies included (Apple Bobbing and the Deserted Tomb) can result in negative outcomes that can do damage to your pets, cause them to become sick, or make you lose Neopoints or items. Proceed with caution!

## To-Do List

Fixes for the following:
* Fruit Machine
* Anchor Management
* Neopian Bank Interest

Underwater Fishing can be done for each pet every day. Currently the script only fishes with your currently active pet; need to get it to do so for all four. 

There are a few more dailies the script should also visit---
* Tombola
* The Snowager
* The Advent Calendar
* Kreludan Meteor
* Potentially Trudy's Surprise and/or the Qasalan Expellibox?

Given that some of the dailies can also be detrimental at times, it'd be nice to let people choose which ones they want. That might take some more work, though.
